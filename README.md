Hi, I'm @JeanMichelBereder.

I'm an experienced digital marketer and currently working as a data analyst.

In addition to my day-to-day work, I am also enrolled in MIT's MicroMaster program in Statistics and Data Science and am pursuing a career as a data scientist.

My favorite languages are Python, SQL, etc.
