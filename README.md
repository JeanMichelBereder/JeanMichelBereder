Hi, I'm @JeanMichelBereder.

I'm an experienced digital marketer and currently working as a data analyst.

In addition to my day-to-day work, I am also enrolled in MIT's MicroMaster program in Statistics and Data Science and am pursuing a career as a data scientist.

My favorite languages are Python, SQL, etc.

>“Professionals practice. True professionals work hard to keep their skills sharp and ready. It is not enough to simply do your daily job and call that practice. Doing your daily job is performance, not practice. Practice is when you specifically exercise your skills outside of the performance of your job for the sole purpose of refining and enhancing those skills.” (The Clean Code, Page 19)

In order to succeed in my career as a data scientist, I set a goal to commit to github every day outside of work.

I'm going to try and see how much of a difference I can make by continuing to write code every day.
